/**
 * @summary
 * A union of all possible file attributes.
 *
 * @description
 *
 * This is copied from the node docs:
 *
 *  - `a` - Open file for appending. The file is created if it does not exist.
 *  - `ax` - Like `a` but fails if the path exists.
 *  - `a+` - Open file for reading and appending.The file is created if it does not exist.
 *  - `ax+` - Like `a+` but fails if the path exists.
 *  - `as` - Open file for appending in synchronous mode. The file is created if it does not exist.
 *  - `as+` - Open file for reading and appending in synchronous mode. The file is created if it does not exist.
 *  - `r` - Open file for reading. An exception occurs if the file does not exist.
 *  - `r+` - Open file for reading and writing. An exception occurs if the file does not exist.
 *  - `rs+` - Open file for reading and writing in synchronous mode. Instructs the operating system to bypass the local file system cache.
 *  - `w` - Open file for writing. The file is created (if it does not exist) or truncated (if it exists).
 *  - `wx` - Like `w` but fails if the path exists.
 *  - `w+` - Open file for reading and writing. The file is created (if it does not exist) or truncated (if it exists).
 *  - `wx+` - Like `w+` but fails if the path exists.
 *
 * @todo
 * Create a separate type for each string literal so each has a description on hover.
 * A quick test proved that this doesn't work the way I expected it to.
